.SH NAME
sfcbrepos \- Script to rebuild the Small-Footprint CIM Broker (sfcb) class repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sfcbrepos
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
sfcbrepos rebuilds the sfcb class repository from the staging

changes to take effect.
.SH OPTIONS
Supported command line options are:

\fB\-c\fR \fIschemadir\fR
Path to obtain the CIM Schema classes.
Default is \fI@datadir@/sfcb\fR
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIstagingdir\fR
Path to sfcb staging area containing class MOFs and registration files
Default is \fI@localstatedir@/lib/sfcb/stage\fR
.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fIregistrationdir\fR
Path to the sfcb registration directory, containing the root of the class
repository directory tree. 
Default is \fI@localstatedir@/lib/sfcb/registration\fR
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Force option. Without this option you will be prompted to confirm creating a 
new class repository (and delete the old one). Setting this option will
rebuild the new sfcb repository without prompting.
.TP
\fB\-X\fR \fIplatform\fR
